nemesis is in ALPHA development status and is HIGHLY UNSTABLE.
The API is subject to radical changes, and therefore examples can be oftenly
found BROKEN.

A. Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nemesis consists of two parts: a C++ core, embedding the Python interpreter, 
capable of undertaking a wide variety of static/transient/eigenvalue problems 
accounting for material and/or geometrical nonlinearities, and extras, a set 
of Python scripts that access the core and exploit usability in simple or 
more complicated tasks, including pre- and post-processing.

Some of the available features in nemesis are: bar/beam/triangle/quad/brick 
elements, uniaxial elastic/hardening/cyclic/viscoplastic materials, von Mises/
Mohr-Coulomb multiaxial elasto-viscoplastic materials, initial/modified/full 
Newton-Raphson and BFGS algorithms, load/displacement/arc-lenght controls and 
connection to sql databases. 

B. Contents 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains the following subdirectories:
* bld, for the makefiles,
* dat, where you may find some examples,
* dox, for the doxygen documentation,
* msc, for miscelaneous files,
* sci, for SciTe costumization files, and
* src, where you can find the source.


C. Installation

1. python.
2. blas/lapack.
3. mpich2.
