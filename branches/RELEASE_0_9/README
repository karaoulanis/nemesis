nemesis is an experimental finite element code.

nemesis is in ALPHA development status and is HIGHLY UNSTABLE.
In order to build nemesis (only on win32 by now) you also need:
1. python.
2. blas/lapack.
3. mpich2.
4. petsc.
5. sqlite.
6. vld.
7. ...
A makefile for Linux will be SOON available.

nemesis consists of two parts: a C++ core, embedding the Python interpreter, 
capable of undertaking a wide variety of static/transient/eigenvalue problems 
accounting for material and/or geometrical nonlinearities, and extras, a set 
of Python scripts that access the core and exploit usability in simple or 
more complicated tasks, including pre- and post-processing.

Some of the available features in nemesis are: bar/beam/triangle/quad/brick 
elements, uniaxial elastic/hardening/cyclic/viscoplastic materials, 
von Mises/Mohr-Coulomb multiaxial elasto-viscoplastic materials, 
initial/modified/full Newton-Raphson and BFGS algorithms, 
load/displacement/arc-lenght controls and connection to sql databases. 

This directory contains the following subdirectories:
* bld, for the makefiles,
* dat, (empty at the moment) where you may find some examples and
* src, where you can find the source.
